# Login-Dashboard
TASK- Create a basic frontend of a login dashboard with the below mentioned  functionality :-

The user name field should only accept an email format. The validation should happen through Javascript.

The password field must be a masked field i.e. should not reveal what's being entered. 

The password field should not accept any special character other than @ and must contain an uppercase letter and a number.

This is based on django :- https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/intro/tutorial01/.

After installing django, the user should run the below command inside "smartserv" folder :- python manage.py runserver.

This command will start the server :- http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

User should open this link in any of his/her web browser and he/she can view the login page.
